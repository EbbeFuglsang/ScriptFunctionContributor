__Script_function_contributor__

URCap sample that, like the samples ScriptFunctionSwing and ScriptFunctionHTML, demonstrates the principle of Function and FunctionModel.

In addation the script function contributed is located in a seperate .script file, that is parsed an added. So you can make your own contribution simply by adding/modifying the script file and building the URCap.
